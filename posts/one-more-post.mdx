description: "I have developed a machine learning model that can take a PDF as input, convert it to text using OpenAI embedding, and store it in Pinecone DB. It enables users to do semantic searches and ask questions, providing prompt and accurate answers through an LLM. It enhances the way we interact with PDF documents, allowing for quicker and more efficient information retrieval."
