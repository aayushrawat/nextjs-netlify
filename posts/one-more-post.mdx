A Machine Learning model based on Langchain's LLM API that takes a PDF as input, convert it to text, then using OpenAI embedding converts text to vectors, and store it in Pinecone Cloud DB for semantic searching. It enables users to do semantic searches and ask questions, providing prompt and accurate answers through an LLM. There's another one [here](https://bookmindai.onrender.com).
